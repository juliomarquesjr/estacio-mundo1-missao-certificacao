    # :param win: the main window or Toplevel window to center

    # Apparently a common hack to get the window size. Temporarily hide the
    # window to avoid update_idletasks() drawing the window in the wrong
    # position.
    win.update_idletasks()  # Update "requested size" from geometry manager

    # define window dimensions width and height
    width = win.winfo_width()
    frm_width = win.winfo_rootx() - win.winfo_x()
    win_width = width + 2 * frm_width

    titlebar_height = win.winfo_rooty() - win.winfo_y()
    win_height = height + titlebar_height + frm_width

    # Get the window position from the top dynamically as well as position from left or right as follows
    x = win.winfo_screenwidth() // 2 - win_width // 2
    y = win.winfo_screenheight() // 2 - win_height // 2

    # this is the line that will center your window
    win.geometry('{}x{}+{}+{}'.format(width, height, x, y))

    # This seems to draw the window frame immediately, so only call deiconify()
    # after setting correct window position
    win.deiconify()
